# Ride_Sharing
Exploratory Data Analysis for a ride sharing application. We analyze the data to find if there are some indicators to predict driver churn behaviour. For this project, a driver is defined as churned if hedoesn't drive for 30 days.

The dataset consis of 3 csv files - 

* driver_ids.csv - A file containing basic information about the drivers (driver id, onboarding date).
* ride_ids.csv - A mapping between ride ids and driver ids.
* ride_timestamps.csv - This file contains information about rides (ride duration, ride distance, pick up time etc.).

We merge the 3 datasets together to get relevant data points for our analysis.

In doing this analysis, answered the following questions - 

1) Is there a difference in the avergage ride distances made by churned vs non churned drivers? - 

We see that there is a difference between the ride distances of the drivers who churned vs drivers who didnâ€™t churn, the differences primarily come into play during the weekdays when the non churned drivers make longer rides ~12miles as compared to the drivers who churned ~ 2.5 miles.

2) How do the riding dynamics differ between the churned and non churned drivers on weekdays/weekends? -

* The drivers that were not churned accept more requests early morning and late night.
* On the weekdays, the distribution of requests is almost identical between the two sets of drivers.

3) Is there a difference in the amount of surcharge applied to the rides of churned vs non churned drivers? -

We notice that the surcharge percentage (surcharge duration/ride duration) is higher for non churned drivers than it is for churned drivers and the difference becomes greater on the weekends. This seems to be a major predictor of whether a driver is going to churn or not.

For our analysis we primarily use python's pandas library for data manipulation and seaborn for data visualization.
