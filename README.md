# Ride_Sharing
Exploratory Data Analysis for a ride sharing application. We analyze the data to find if there are some indicators to predict driver churn behaviour. For this project, a driver is defined as churned if hedoesn't drive for 30 days.

The dataset consis of 3 csv files - 

a) driver_ids.csv - A file containing basic information about the drivers (driver id, onboarding date).
b) ride_ids.csv - A mapping between ride ids and driver ids.
c) ride_timestamps.csv - This file contains information about rides (ride duration, ride distance, pick up time etc.).

We merge the 3 datasets together to get relevant data points for our analysis.
